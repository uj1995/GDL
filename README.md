# Highway

Roads with minimum of two marked lanes per direction, motorways, a recommended speed limit (Richtgeschwindigkeit) of 130 km/h

· Generally always stay in right lane. After passing, go back to the right lane. The left lane should only be used for passing

· Passing other vehicles is only allowed on the left side on German roads

# Rural roads

speed limit of 100 km/h, which is routinely reduced to 70 km/h (43 mph) or 80 km/h where the road approaches a junction with a significant side-road.

# City limits

Speed limit within built up areas, which are marked by distinctive rectangular yellow signs showing the name of the village, town or city, of 50 km/h, but residential areas usually have a lower posted speed limit of 30 km/h. if you see a blue sign with white car, children and bike symbols on it (Verkehrsberuhigten Bereichen/ Traffic calming zone), then you must drive at a walking speed.

· Right of way: If there are no traffic signs or signals in an intersection or junction, then the vehicle/cyclist approaching from your right has the right of way ("right before left" rule). Ex: Parking lots,

· one way streets are "opened" to cyclists in both directions

· Stopping at "Zebrastreifen" (literally "zebra stripes") is mandatory when there are people waiting to cross the street and German drivers virtually always stop. Accordingly, many pedestrians will not wait for the car to stop before they use the pedestrian crossing. Not stopping can be charged with a €80 fine and one point.

· When a bus is stopped at a bus stop with its hazard lights flashing, traffic in both directions may only overtake at a speed no more than 7 km/h.

# Some common rules

· A double white line in the middle means no passing. A solid white line beside a dashed line means passing on the dashed side only.

· A solid white line in the middle means, no crossing the lane. You cannot also take left turn crossing the solid white line.

· Before taking turn, observe the traffic signs and decide on which lane you want to join based on, where you want to go.

· If you have a sign with a yellow diamond at an intersection, you have the right of way. If you have a sign which is a white triangle with a red border (yield sign), you must wait for the oncoming traffic to clear.

· When merging, observe the “zipper rule” (Reißverschluß), which states that both lanes feed into the continuing lane, alternating cars from each lane.

o No one lane has priority over the other.

· Lanes going the same direction are separated by dashed white lines. A Solid white line separates the different directions.

# Rule of thumb for Safety distance

Safety distance between cars is mandatory (else penalty of up to 400€ and revoking the driver’s license)

• Three car lengths : Anyone traveling in city traffic must keep a distance of at least 15 meters or three car lengths.

• Half speedometer : For the safety distance outside built-up areas: Half the speedometer in meters. Example: At 70 km / h you have to keep a distance of 35 meters.

• Double distance : In case of bad visibility or bad road conditions you should double your safety distance .

• Side distance: It should be 0.5 meters for trams, 1 meter for two-lane vehicles and 1.5 meters for pedestrians and two-wheeled vehicles

# Turning/Changing direction

1. Turning left or right at a crossing: have to give way to pedestrians or bicyclists who are crossing the road you want to turn into.

2. Turnining left

a. Oncoming vehicles priority

b. If in one way street, stay on the left side of the road

c. Check if its allowed to take left (no solid white line)

d. When left turn in junction, look for the oncoming traffic and giving priority

Useful tips for passing praktische führerscheinprüfung

Duration: Approx 45min

examiner selects route that gives him a good idea of ​​the learner's abilities: this often includes a section in 30s zones and on the freeway. Considers basic tasks such as parking, starting on a slope, reversing or emergency braking

Nobody is perfect in the exam and you will not be expected to do so. So you may make mistakes in the exam. Good performances even compensate for small mistakes, but, one need to avoid Serious mistakes like

· Disregard of the right of way

· passing a red traffic light

· Disregard of stop signs and entry bans

· Breaches of the overtaking ban

· endangering or damaging other road users

1. Check your mirror, speedometer regularly

a. Learn always to look first into the Innenspiegel then Außenspiegel. ALWAYS make the Schulterblick (over the shoulder look) when making turns.

2. Carefully in tight spots (Corners, bad vision, multiple parked cars, 2 way narrow roads, etc)

a. Distance 1 Meter to cars , 1.5 Meter to Pedestrians, Bycycles, etc)

3. Indicators

a. Moving to driving direction (ex: from parking), overtaking and coming back, changing direction, exit in circles, etc.

4. Look over shoulders only to check blind spot, never look and steer at same time.

5. Drive Straight ahead if not told otherwise

6. Vorfahrt

a. Always Stop on the Stop sign for minimum 3 seconds!

b. In zebra crossing , give prio to pedestrians

c. Learn what is Schrittgeschwindigkeit, because of this you can automatically fail the test. It's the speed between 4 and 7 Km/h and if you go over that, let's say 10 Km/h in the Verkehrsberuhigten Bereichen ( Traffic calming zone)

d. When left turn in junction, look for the oncoming traffic and giving priority

e. Buses leaving marked bus stops have the right-of-way.

7. Wenden Umkehren: to turnaround and go back same way

o Leave the main street (if you're on one

o Look for an area on the right side (entrance, parking lots, private property) and drive in a reverse right arc

o If there is nothing on the right side (river, forest, field), look for a road on the left side and drive forwards to the left. Afterwards stay right at the right edge and drive out a backward right arc.

o go back to where you came from

o Tips

· If you have a roundabout in front of you, please use it! Drive around in a circle and you're the other way around.

· Large parking lots are perfect for reversing! Drive to the parking lot and use the large area by driving around in a circle.

· While checking for place to turn, make sure you don’t stop in the no stopping area!

8. Beim Gefahrbremsemanöver/

Gefahrbremsung (hard brake manoeuver), at the Prüfers command, press the both clutch and brake pedals very hard

a. Car parking: Einfahren in eine Parklücke/ into a parking space , Rückwärts fahren in eine Parklücke

a. For reverse parking, you cannot move into the lane of oncoming vehicles for comfort.

b. Reversing: Slow with precision and Safety

b. Final Stop

a. parking brake- First gear- switch off- lock the steering- takeout the key

b. Check mirrors and shoulder block before getting down
